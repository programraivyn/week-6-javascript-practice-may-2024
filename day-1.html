  <p>We already know about variables. A variable can store one value. If we use an object, we can collect many variables into a single "filing cabinet" to organize similar variables.</p>
  <p>For example, all the variables that relate to a certain player can be put into a player object. For example...</p>
  <pre>
    let playerOne, playerTwo;
    
    playerOne = {};
    playerOne.name = "Joe";
    playerOne.score = 54;
    
    playerTwo = {};
    playerTwo.name = "Jane";
    playerTwo.score = 65;  
  </pre>
  
  <p>There are three things to remember when creating and using objects.</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Create the object with curly brackets {}</li>
    <li>Assign the properties of the object with dot notation.</li>
    <li>Access the properties of the object with dot notation.</li>
  </ol>
